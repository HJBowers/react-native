Goal 370: React Native API-Driven App
Hannah Bowers @HJBowers

## Learning objectives
- How to build and start a React-Native app
- How to start a cross platform development environment (iOS/Android)
- How to utilize React-Native's fetch method and/or additional libraries to pull api data

## Instructions:
- *Step 1* - [Refer to this scaffold repo](https://github.com/pllearns/react-native-starter-code), follow the `readme` instructions, and create your own repo for the code.

- *Step 2* - Find a third party api to play with. Suggestions:
  - [OMDB Api](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
  - [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
  - [Yelp Api](https://www.yelp.com/developers)

- *Step 3* - Refer to `README.md` file within searchAPI folder for setup.

### Specs
- [x] __10:__ you have an app component that feeds both android and ios js files
- [x] __10:__ you can start the app with both `react-native run-ios` and `react-native run-android`
- [ ] __10:__ you have at least 3 tests *written* using `jest`
- [x] __10:__ you have a home page
- [x] __10:__ you have at least one extra screen to navigate to
- [x] __10:__ a submit button for search that fetches data
- [x] __50:__ You are able to render third api data through navigating to a separate screen (example: a search button that `onClick` takes you to a results page.
- [x] __30:__ You have a complete `readme` that documents how to start your app and set up the dev environment *hint: your forked repo will start you in the right direction*
- [x] __30:__ You are properly protecting sensitive api ids and secrets
